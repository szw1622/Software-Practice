# Comments to Evaluators:
Our ClientGUI project stands on its own.

# Assignment Specific Topics
We managed to complete all the minimum requirements for assignment 8 and the Agario game can be played with all the expected functionaility being correct.
We also added an extra feature in GUI to the number of deaths of the player in each game while he or she is still connecting to server.
PS: Due to different size of computers, error text box may not show up if open in default computer screen size, but we do have error message shown in there
