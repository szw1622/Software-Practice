// Skeleton written by Joe Zachary for CS 3500, September 2013
// Read the entire skeleton carefully and completely before you

// Version 1.1 (9/22/13 11:45 a.m.)

// Change log:
//  (Version 1.1) Repaired mistake in GetTokens
//  (Version 1.1) Changed specification of second constructor to
//                clarify description of how validation works

// (Daniel Kopta) 
// Version 1.2 (9/10/17) 

// Change log:
//  (Version 1.2) Changed the definition of equality with regards
//                to numeric tokens
