# Comments to Evaluators:

I don't have anything to tell the graders

# Assignment Specific Topics

I think every part of my project is valuable. The lecture slide says that the code should be ~100 lines, but mine is 500 lines. I do not know why. I talked about this assignment with one of my friends. Most of our words are related to the testers and the ArgumentException. We did not share the code with each other.

The algorithm is really smart. If I start this project from the start, I might have gone mad.

As the words I said above, I really want to figure out why my code is so "heavier" than it should be. I think some helper method can fix it, but at most, it might be reduced to about 300 lines. This problem will keep influencing my efficiency.

# Consulted Peers:

List any peers (or other people) in the class (or outside for that matter) that you talked with about the project for more than one minute.
