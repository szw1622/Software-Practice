# What has been finished?
- The structure for storage of nodes has been changed from `int* Node[]` to `map<char, Node>`.
- The logic modification for some code snippet to fit the new structure. 

# What Is Left?
- The comments, including the block comment at the head of every .cpp files, should be optimized.
- Some testers (using googletest). **BUT DO NOT ADD THE GOOGLETEST SOURCE**
- Makefile modification for googletest.
